# ToDrawATopology

## How to use
Simply drop these files, in their folder, into the scripts/addons folder of Blender and run the setup script. After refreshing the addon menu in Blender you should then see the addon under the "development" category.

## Installation

Clone this repository in to the add-ons folder of your Blender installation. The folder can be found at `YourBlenderFolder/2.79/scripts/addons` for Blender version 2.79x.

Navigate in to the `drawing_a_topology` folder and run the command `python3 project_setup.py "PathToYourBlender/2.79/python/bin/pip" install`. This will install the necessary packages to run the add-on. If the system cannot find pip for some reason then run the command `PathToBlender/2.79/python/bin/python3.5m PathToBlender/2.79/python/lib/python3.5/ensurepip` to make sure pip is installed in Blender.
